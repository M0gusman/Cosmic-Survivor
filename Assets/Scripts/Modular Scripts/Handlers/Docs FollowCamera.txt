Sure! Below is a simple `FollowCamera.cs` script for Unity that allows a camera to smoothly follow a target object, such as a player character. You can adjust the distance and height of the camera relative to the target.

### FollowCamera.cs

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The target to follow
    public float distance = 5.0f; // Distance from the target
    public float height = 2.0f; // Height above the target
    public float damping = 5.0f; // Smoothness of the follow

    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            // Calculate the desired position
            Vector3 desiredPosition = target.position - target.forward * distance + Vector3.up * height;
            // Smoothly interpolate to the desired position
            Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, damping * Time.deltaTime);
            // Update the camera position
            transform.position = smoothedPosition;

            // Optional: Rotate the camera to look at the target
            transform.LookAt(target);
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use

1. **Create a New Script**: In your Unity project, create a new C# script and name it `FollowCamera.cs`.

2. **Copy and Paste**: Copy the code above and paste it into the `FollowCamera.cs` script.

3. **Attach the Script**: Attach this script to your camera GameObject in the Unity editor.

4. **Assign the Target**: In the Inspector, assign the `target` field to the GameObject you want the camera to follow (e.g., the player).

5. **Adjust Parameters**: You can modify the `distance`, `height`, and `damping` parameters to fit your needs.

### Notes

- The `LateUpdate` method is used to ensure that the camera follows the target after all character movement has been processed.
- You can adjust the damping to make the camera movement more or less smooth.

Feel free to customize it further to suit your game's requirements!

Here’s a simple `FollowCamera.cs` script tailored for a 2D game in Unity. This script will allow the camera to follow a target (like a player) smoothly along the X and Y axes.

### FollowCamera.cs

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The target to follow
    public float offsetX = 0f; // Horizontal offset from the target
    public float offsetY = 0f; // Vertical offset from the target
    public float smoothing = 0.1f; // Smoothing factor

    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            // Calculate the desired position
            Vector3 desiredPosition = new Vector3(target.position.x + offsetX, target.position.y + offsetY, transform.position.z);
            // Smoothly interpolate to the desired position
            Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothing);
            // Update the camera position
            transform.position = smoothedPosition;
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use

1. **Create the Script**: In Unity, create a new C# script named `FollowCamera.cs`.

2. **Copy and Paste**: Paste the code above into the new script.

3. **Attach the Script**: Attach this script to your Camera GameObject.

4. **Assign the Target**: In the Inspector, drag your player GameObject (or whichever object you want to follow) into the `target` field.

5. **Adjust Parameters**: You can modify `offsetX`, `offsetY`, and `smoothing` to fit your game’s camera behavior.

### Notes

- The camera will follow the target's position smoothly, maintaining the specified offsets.
- Ensure that your camera is set to Orthographic mode if you're working in 2D.

Feel free to tweak the parameters to get the desired camera movement!

To create a camera that follows a target while also extending towards the cursor (similar to the zoom-out feature in **Hotline Miami**), you can modify the `FollowCamera` script to take the mouse position into account. The camera will smoothly follow the target while adjusting its position based on where the mouse cursor is located.

Here’s an updated version of the `FollowCamera.cs` script for this purpose:

### FollowCamera.cs

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The target to follow
    public float offset = 1.0f; // Distance from the target
    public float smoothing = 0.1f; // Smoothing factor
    public float zoomOutFactor = 0.5f; // How much to zoom out towards the cursor

    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            // Get the mouse position in world space
            Vector3 mousePosition = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
            mousePosition.z = 0; // Set z to 0 for 2D

            // Calculate the desired position
            Vector3 targetPosition = target.position;
            Vector3 directionToCursor = (mousePosition - targetPosition).normalized;

            // Calculate the new camera position based on the cursor position
            Vector3 desiredPosition = targetPosition + directionToCursor * offset * zoomOutFactor;

            // Smoothly interpolate to the desired position
            Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothing);
            // Update the camera position
            transform.position = new Vector3(smoothedPosition.x, smoothedPosition.y, transform.position.z);
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use

1. **Create the Script**: Create a new C# script named `FollowCamera.cs` in Unity.

2. **Copy and Paste**: Paste the code above into the script.

3. **Attach the Script**: Attach this script to your Camera GameObject.

4. **Assign the Target**: In the Inspector, drag your player GameObject (or the object you want the camera to follow) into the `target` field.

5. **Adjust Parameters**: Modify the `offset`, `smoothing`, and `zoomOutFactor` values to achieve the desired camera behavior.

### Notes

- **Mouse Position**: The script converts the mouse position from screen space to world space, allowing the camera to extend towards the cursor.
- **Offset**: This determines how far the camera is from the target. Increasing the `zoomOutFactor` will make the camera follow the cursor more aggressively.
- **Z Position**: Since this is a 2D game, ensure the camera's Z position remains fixed (usually at 0).

Feel free to tweak these settings to get the desired effect!

To achieve a camera that pans smoothly between the target and the cursor position without avoiding the center of the target, you can adjust the script to calculate a midpoint between the target's position and the mouse position. This way, the camera will follow a point that’s influenced by both the target and the cursor.

Here’s how you can modify the `FollowCamera` script:

### FollowCamera.cs

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class FollowCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target; // The target to follow
    public float offset = 1.0f; // Distance from the target
    public float smoothing = 0.1f; // Smoothing factor
    public float zoomOutFactor = 0.5f; // How much to zoom out towards the cursor

    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target != null)
        {
            // Get the mouse position in world space
            Vector3 mousePosition = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
            mousePosition.z = 0; // Set z to 0 for 2D

            // Calculate the midpoint between the target and the mouse position
            Vector3 targetPosition = target.position;
            Vector3 midPoint = Vector3.Lerp(targetPosition, mousePosition, zoomOutFactor);

            // Calculate the desired camera position based on the midpoint
            Vector3 desiredPosition = midPoint + (targetPosition - midPoint).normalized * offset;

            // Smoothly interpolate to the desired position
            Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothing);
            // Update the camera position
            transform.position = new Vector3(smoothedPosition.x, smoothedPosition.y, transform.position.z);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Midpoint Calculation**: The camera now calculates a midpoint between the target's position and the mouse position using `Vector3.Lerp`. This helps the camera to pan smoothly towards both the target and the cursor.

2. **Desired Position**: The desired camera position is adjusted to maintain the specified offset from the midpoint.

3. **Smooth Movement**: The camera position is smoothly interpolated towards the desired position to create a smooth panning effect.

### How to Use

1. **Create the Script**: Create a new C# script named `FollowCamera.cs` in Unity.

2. **Copy and Paste**: Paste the modified code above into the script.

3. **Attach the Script**: Attach this script to your Camera GameObject.

4. **Assign the Target**: In the Inspector, drag your player GameObject (or the object you want the camera to follow) into the `target` field.

5. **Adjust Parameters**: Modify the `offset`, `smoothing`, and `zoomOutFactor` values to get the desired camera behavior.

### Tips

- **Offset**: The offset will control how far the camera should be from the midpoint. Adjust it to fit your gameplay.
- **Smoothing**: Increasing the `smoothing` value will make the camera movement smoother, while decreasing it will make the camera more responsive.

This should give you the desired panning effect as the camera smoothly transitions between the player and the cursor position! Feel free to tweak the parameters for the best experience.
