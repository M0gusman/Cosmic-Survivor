To add a **despawn time** for the projectiles in your `Projectile.cs` script, you can set a lifespan for each projectile after which it will automatically destroy itself.

Here's how you can modify your `Projectile.cs` to include a despawn time:

### Updated `Projectile.cs` Script with Despawn Time

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float baseDamage = 10f;   // Base damage of the projectile
    public float damage;             // Final damage (after multiplier)
    public float despawnTime = 5f;   // Time in seconds before the projectile is automatically destroyed

    void Start()
    {
        // Schedule the projectile to be destroyed after `despawnTime` seconds
        Destroy(gameObject, despawnTime);
    }

    // Example method when projectile hits something
    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
    {
        // Try to get the ShipStats component from the object it collided with
        ShipStats targetStats = collision.GetComponent<ShipStats>();
        if (targetStats != null)
        {
            // Apply damage to the target
            targetStats.TakeDamage(damage);
        }

        // Destroy the projectile after hitting something
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}
```

### Key Additions:

1. **`despawnTime` Variable**:
   - This is a public variable that defines how long the projectile will exist before it automatically despawns.
   - You can set the value in the Unity Editor for each projectile prefab, or you can adjust it dynamically in code if necessary.

2. **`Destroy(gameObject, despawnTime)`**:
   - This method schedules the projectile to be destroyed after a specific amount of time. In this case, after `despawnTime` seconds.
   - By placing it in the `Start()` method, the projectile will be destroyed automatically after it is instantiated, even if it doesnâ€™t hit anything.

### How it Works:
- **Projectile Lifespan**: When a projectile is instantiated, it will automatically destroy itself after the specified `despawnTime` has passed (e.g., 5 seconds).
- **Collision Handling**: If the projectile hits a target before the `despawnTime`, it is destroyed immediately after dealing damage using `Destroy(gameObject)`.

### Despawn Time in Unity:
1. **In the Inspector**: You can now modify the `despawnTime` directly in the Unity Inspector by selecting the projectile prefab and adjusting the value to control how long the projectile stays alive.
   
2. **Default Despawn Time**: If no changes are made in the Inspector, the default despawn time will be 5 seconds as defined in the script.

### Optional: Dynamic Despawn Time
If you want to dynamically set the despawn time based on gameplay conditions (for example, some projectiles may last longer), you can do so by setting the `despawnTime` value programmatically before instantiating or shortly after instantiating the projectile.

Example:
```csharp
GameObject projectile = Instantiate(projectilePrefab, firePoint.position, firePoint.rotation);
Projectile projectileScript = projectile.GetComponent<Projectile>();
projectileScript.despawnTime = 3f; // Set a custom despawn time for this instance
```

This setup ensures your projectiles won't linger indefinitely in the scene and will clean up after a set time, reducing memory usage and keeping the game performant.
